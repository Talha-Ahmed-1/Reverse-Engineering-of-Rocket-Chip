# Reverse Engineering of Rocket Chip
Rocket chip is a chip generator that allows you to set up different configurations and these configurations are specified through Chisel parameters. Reverse Engineering of Rocket Chip journey starts from (Micro Electronic Research Lab) MERL which is working in the field of RISC V Processor development and Research. The purpose of Reverse Engineering of Rocket Chip is to get aware of the modules used in rocket chip and make Micro Architecture Specification (MAS) documentation as Rocket chip doesnâ€™t have any MAS documentation available yet. Another main purpose is to increase Rocket chip code reusability so every programmer can easily understand its code and manipulate it according to its desired configuration by changing Chisel Parameters. We decode basic modules of rocket chip by taking understanding of its code line by line with the help of Scala and Chisel expertise. We convert these modules code understanding into flow charts and start making Micro Architecture Specification (MAS) documentation. We make flow charts for different modules of Rocket Chip. After completion of flow charts, we make block diagrams of Rocket Chip modules according to its configuration pin in and out.
